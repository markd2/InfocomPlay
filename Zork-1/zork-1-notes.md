  WELCOME TO ZORK!
  ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will
  explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No
  computer should be without one!

North of House
  You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here,
  and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds
  through the trees.
