Leaflet (treasure)
  WELCOME TO ZORK!
  ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will
  explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No
  computer should be without one!

North of House
  You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here,
  and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds
  through the trees.

Canyon View
  You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here
  there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
  upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the
  mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the
  Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with
  rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern.
  To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for
   miles around.
  A path leads northwest. 
  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

Rocky Ledge
  You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river
  canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls
  twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below
  you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears
  climbable.

End of Rainbow
  You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid
  River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the
   White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from
   above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path
   continues to the southwest.

Up a Tree
  You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large
  branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
  Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.

  In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
  apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with
  fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
  mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with
  a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.

  You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

Kitchen
  You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have
  been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the
  west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney
  leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.

  On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
  _(the sack contains a lunch, and a clove of garlic)_
  A bottle is sitting on the table.
  The glass bottle contains:
    A quantity of water

  door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be
  nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of
  the room.
  (read lettering: The engravings translate to "This space
  intentionally left blank."
  Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
  A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

Cellar
  You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading

  stairway leading upward. The room is deafeningly loud with an
  undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems to reverberate from all of
  the walls, making it difficult even to think.
  
  On the ground is a large platinum bar.  (Can't pick up) "Echo" (quiets room)

Engravings Cave

  There are old engravings on the walls here.

  (examine engravings) The engravings were incised in the living rock
  of the cave wall by an unknown hand. They depict, in symbolic form,
  the beliefs of the ancient Zorkers. Skillfully interwoven with the bas
  reliefs are excerpts illustrating the major religious tenets of that
  time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems to have considered them
  blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.

Dam

  quite a tourist attraction in times far distant. There are paths to
  the north, south, and west, and a scramble down.

  The sluice gates on the dam are closed. Behind the dam, there can be
  seen a wide reservoir. Water is pouring over the top of the now
  abandoned dam.

  There is a control panel here, on which a large metal bolt is
  mounted. Directly above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

  "Flood Control Dam #3
   FCD#3 was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to
   harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was supported by a grant of
   37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit
   Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of
   370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and
   193 feet wide at the top. The lake created behind the dam has a volume
   of 1.7 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a
   shore line of 36 thousand feet.

   We will now point out some of the more interesting features of FCD#3
   as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

  downstream.

  There is a folded pile of plastic here which has a small valve attached. (raft)

Studio
  This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors
  are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough,
  nothing of value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an
  open door (also covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads
  up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems
  unlikely you could get back down.

  Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper. (zork owner's manual)

  You are the privileged owner of ZORK I: The Great Underground Empire,

Temple
  This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an
  ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten
  language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall
  is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through
  huge marble pillars.

  Prayer:
    The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script, rarely used today. It
    seems to be a philippic against small insects, absent-mindedness, and
    the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The final verse
    consigns trespassers to the land of the dead. All evidence indicates
    that the beliefs of the ancient Zorkers were obscure.

  There is a brass bell here.

Egyptian Room
  This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an
  ascending staircase to the west.

  The solid-gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.

  (open coffin)
  A sceptre, possibly that of ancient Egypt itself, is in the
  coffin. The sceptre is ornamented with colored enamel, and tapers to a
  sharp point.

Altar
  This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what
  appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor
  which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.

  On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
  On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.

  Book:
    Commandment #12592

    Oh ye who go about saying unto each:  "Hello sailor":
    Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
    Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
    Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
    Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
    Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
    Unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
    Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

Entrance to Hades
  You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed
    Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!
  The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
  mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some
  hideous fate, can be heard.  The way through the gate is barred by
  evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.

  Ring Bell:
    The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The
    wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face
    you. On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror
    takes shape.  
  In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).
  (and if you mess up, the bell is too hot to handle)
  (and don't try lighting candles with the torch

  YOU too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of PAPER SHUFFLING!

  Mr. Anderson of Muddle, Mass. says: "Before I took this course I was a
  lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at GUE Tech I feel really
  important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

  Dr. Blank had this to say: "Ten short days ago all I could look
  forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor. Now I have a promising
  future and make really big Zorkmids."

  GUE Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone. But when
  you earn your degree from GUE Tech, your future will be brighter.
