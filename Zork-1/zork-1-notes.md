Leaflet (treasure)
  WELCOME TO ZORK!
  ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will
  explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No
  computer should be without one!

North of House
  You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here,
  and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds
  through the trees.

Canyon View
  You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here
  there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
  upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the
  mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the
  Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with
  rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern.
  To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for
   miles around.
  A path leads northwest. 
  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

Rocky Ledge
  You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river
  canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls
  twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below
  you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears
  climbable.

Canyon Bottom
  You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable
  here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by
  below. To the north is a narrow path.

End of Rainbow
  You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid
  River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the
   White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from
   above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path
   continues to the southwest.

Up a Tree
  You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large
  branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
  Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.

  In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
  apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with
  fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
  mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with
  a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.

  You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

Kitchen
  You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have
  been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the
  west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney
  leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.

  On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
  _(the sack contains a lunch, and a clove of garlic)_
  A bottle is sitting on the table.
  The glass bottle contains:
    A quantity of water

Living Room
  You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden
  door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be
  nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of
  the room.
  (read lettering: The engravings translate to "This space
  intentionally left blank."
  Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
  A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

Cellar
  You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
  north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a
  steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
  Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

The Troll Room
  This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a
  forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps
  made by an axe) mar the walls.
  A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
  out of the room.
  Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

Resevoir South

  deep and wide for crossing.  There is a path along the stream to the
  east or west, a steep pathway climbing southwest along the edge of a
  chasm, and a path leading into a canyon to the southeast.
